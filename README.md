# Progressive Web Applications (PWA): Budget Tracker

## Description

Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information at any time is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to the success of an application that handles users’ financial information.

This application does just that, allowing users to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. Users also receive a running total and are able to access the functional, deployed application on Heroku.
